# Animated Scatter Plot - Life Expectancy vs Fertility

![Life Expectancy vs  Fertility(1969-2015)](https://github.com/Taibh22/animated_Scatterplot/assets/120493086/ac5648b7-da77-437e-b480-558da10a2539)

This project is an animated scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between life expectancy and fertility across different countries over time. The data is sourced from the Gapminder dataset, which contains data on various indicators for countries around the world.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using pip by running the following command:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Animated_Scatterplot.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to generate the animated scatter plot.

The notebook contains detailed comments to explain what each section of the code does.

## Results

The animated scatter plot shows the relationship between life expectancy and fertility across different countries over time. Each data point represents a country, and the color of the data point represents the continent that the country is located in. The animation shows how the relationship between life expectancy and fertility has changed overtime, with each frame representing a different year.

The plot includes a legend that shows the color-coding for the continents, and the x-axis and y-axis labels indicate the indicators being compared (life expectancy and fertility).

## Future Work

There are several ways that this project could be extended or improved in the future, such as:

- Adding more indicators to the plot to explore other relationships between different variables.
- Adding interactive features to the plot, such as tooltips or hover effects, to make it more user-friendly.
- Optimizing the code to improve performance and reduce runtime.
